# Parsing Randomness
**Seminar Probabilistic Programming** RWTH, summersemester 2023

Author: Meret Unbehaun, Advisor: Phillip Schroer

This repository is supposed to demonstrate the ideas from the paper [TODO](Add original paper) on the example of binary Integer trees.

## Implementations
First of all, the concept of a Free Generator (the correct data type implementation) is programmed according to [TODO].
- This also includes the interpretations, here as a Generator and as a Parser

This data structure is then concretely implemented for the tree example.
- For this example, also a [Generator] and [Parser] are programmed


## Execution
The whole project is represented in a Jupyter notebook with this [Haskell kernel](https://github.com/IHaskell/IHaskell) implementation utilised.

Either look at the already compiled file, or follow the setup in the linked repository and execute the script yourself locally.
